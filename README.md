Purchase Order Enhancement
================================================

Business Concepts
-----------------
On a Odoo system with a high volume of purchases, the number of purchase orders displayed in the list view can become huge.
We don't want to see canceled or locked purchase orders. If a purchase order is archived, it will be hidden from the purchase orders list view. The person who has manager profile can archive old orders.
The system should automatic archive the old canceled/locked purchase orders. In the other hand, we're using ABC system, so we also want to archive canceled or locked orders by using HTTP request.

Another improvements, we want to have the phone number in the US domestic format at the contact information and want to know what payment terms apply for these purchase orders at the reports.
